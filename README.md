# Music-Genre-Classification-System
This repository contains the code for a Music Genre Classification System developed using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The system classifies music tracks into genres based on audio features extracted from the GTZAN Music Genre Dataset. The application is built with Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend..

# Key Features
# User Registration & Login: 
Users can create an account and log in to access the application securely.
# Audio File Upload: 
Users can upload .au music files for genre classification.
# Genre Prediction: 
The LSTM model classifies uploaded music files into predefined genres.
# Interactive UI: 
The frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a clean and responsive user experience.
